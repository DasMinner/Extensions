# Extensions
You can find some extensions for Players, Entitys and some other stuff.
The extensions are made for kotlin (kspigot)

# Examples:
If you want to drop an item you have to write:

`
dropItem(location, ItemStack(Material))
`


Create a location:
`
val locationanme = location("worldname", x, y, z)
`
