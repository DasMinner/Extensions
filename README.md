# Extensions
You can find some extensions for Players, Entitys and some other stuff.
The extensions are made in/for kotlin (kspigot)

## Examples:
If you want to drop an item you have to write:

`
dropItem(location, Material)
`


Create a location:

`
val locationame = location("worldname", x, y, z)
`
